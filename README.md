# Possession Football Project

## Introduction
Does possession matter? Over the course of a season, does having more possession translate into better results and more points? What is the relationship between possession and performance?  
This project explores the link between possession and success in the Premier League, looking at whether controlling the ball leads to better outcomes — and where the exceptions lie.

## Goals
- Check the relationship between possession and total points in the Premier League last season.
- Identify and plot exceptions to see:
  - Which teams followed the general trend of possession → points.
  - Which teams had high possession but fewer points than expected.
  - Which teams outperformed their possession levels in terms of points.
- Explore other indicators of passing that might better explain points over a season.
- Conduct basic statistical analysis (details in the notebook).
- Define the scope for further analysis in future iterations.
